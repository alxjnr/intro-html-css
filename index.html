        <p>
            Poppy was first introduced to the family as a Subway sandwich sized 10 week old. She was placed next to my dad on our sofa and immediately imprinted on him. Her attatchment to my dad has since developed into a constant obsession and everyone else is ignored. Regardless, she is a good dog.

        <p>
            Bichpoos, also known as Poochons, are a hybrid breed created by crossing a Bichon Frise and a Poodle. These small, fluffy dogs are known for their social, friendly, and intelligent personalities. They are playful and affectionate, making them perfect for families and companions. Bichpoos typically weigh between 8 and 20 pounds, and come in a variety of colors, including apricot, cream, and black. They have thick, curly coats that don't shed, making them ideal for people with allergies. Bichpoos are active, and require regular exercise and mental stimulation. They are intelligent and respond well to obedience training, making them great for those looking for an obedient and loyal pet.
